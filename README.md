# Home-services-provider-platform-Proyojon-Proyojon

> A trusted home-services marketplace for residents and service providers in Dhaka.

Proyojon is basically a web-based platform that helps residents in restricted areas of
Dhaka, such as Bashundhara R/A, DOHS and Cantonment securely book verified maintenance workers.
Customers can request services based on their needs and location. Moderators check the workers'
credentials and assign bookings. Workers then manage and complete the jobs. Proyojon uses a three-role
booking system with role-based access and status tracking. Besides, it has an AI chatbot feature that can
provide the urgent temporary solution for the customer. This system makes hiring safer and more
organized than using street vendors
